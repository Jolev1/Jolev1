Self-taught and always up-to-date web designer, focused on creating modern and efficient websites. From initial planning with wireframes and
user experience to design implementation, I guarantee a well-structured and secure site.

Complete management of the frontend and management of the web server or hosting for optimal performance. In addition, I am in charge of the continuous maintenance of the websites, ensuring their correct operation over time.
I use tools such as Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager and Microsoft Clarity to understand user behavior, thus improving interaction. I also capture and track leads, easily integrating them into CRM systems for efficient management.
